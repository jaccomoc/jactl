Jacsal is a scripting language whose syntax is a combination of bits from Java, Groovy, and Perl.
Jacsal can be embedded into your Java-based application to provide a secure way to provide
extensions and/or customisations for your users. Jacsal compiles to Java bytecode and has
support for continuations to make sure that scripts never block your event-loop threads.
