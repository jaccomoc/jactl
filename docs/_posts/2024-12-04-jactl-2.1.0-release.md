[Jactl](https://jactl.io) 2.1.0 is a new release with a handful of enhancements and bug fixes, as well as a brand new
IntelliJ plugin.

## Enhancements

### IntelliJ Plugin

There is a new IntelliJ plugin available.
Search for "Jactl" within Settings -> Plugins -> Marketplace of IntelliJ.
It can also be downloaded and built from the source code at [Jactl IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/jaccomoc/jactl-intellij-plugin).

It offers the following features:

* Syntax colouring
* Error highlighting
* Intelligent indenting
* Code reformat
* Completions
* Show definition/show usages navigation
* Comment/uncomment selected code
* Rename refactoring
* Move file/move directory refactoring
* Paired brace matching
* Build/run/debug support

### Postfix if/unless Enhancement ([#58](https://github.com/jaccomoc/jactl/issues/58))

Previously it was possible to use `if` or `unless` after some statements such as:
```groovy
x = 3 and return if y > 10
continue unless i == j
```

Now `if` and `unless` can be used after any expression.
For example:
```groovy
def stats = [sum / cnt if cnt > 0, sum, cnt] 
```

When the conditional part of the expression (the `if` or `unless` part) is false the result will be `null`.

### For Loops with Implicitly Created Variable ([#61](https://github.com/jaccomoc/jactl/issues/61))

For loops can now use a loop variable without having to declare it:
```groovy
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  ...
}
```

If the variable already exists within the scope, then it is reused.
If there was no variable of that name, it will be automatically declared (with appropriate type).
Furthermore, the variable will also be visible after the `for` loop:
```groovy
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  break if test(i)
}
println "Found value that matches: $i"
```

Variables that have an explicit declaration only have visibility within the for loop itself:
```groovy
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  break if test(i)
}
// i is not visible here
```

### Allow null Dereference in Left-Hand Side of ?: Operator ([#69](https://github.com/jaccomoc/jactl/issues/69))

The `?:` operator is used to provide a default value when the left-hand side is `null`:
```groovy
name = x.info.name ?: 'no name provided'
```
If `x.info.name` returns null, then `'no name provided'` is used as the value instead.

To deal with situations where `x` or `x.info` could also be null, you would previously have to write:
```groovy
name = x?.info?.name ?: 'no name provided'
```

The `?:` operator has now been enhanced to cater for these situations and will return the right-hand value if
a `null` dereference would have occurred on the left-hand side.

This now works if `x`, `x.info`, or `x.info.name` are `null`:
```groovy
name = x.info.name ?: 'no name provided'
```

### Support Binding Variables for "*" in List Patterns of Switch Statements ([#70](https://github.com/jaccomoc/jactl/issues/70))

In Jactl, the `switch` statement (which is actually an expression since it evaluates to a result) supports matching
against patterns that can be simple literal values (as in a traditional `switch`) or can match based on type and
structure.
In particular, list patterns can be used to match lists based on the list size and list content.

For example:
```groovy
switch (x) {
  [_]        -> 'list with single element'
  [int,int]  -> 'list of two ints'
  [String,*] -> 'list beginning with a String'
}
```

It is possible to supply the name of a binding variable to bind to specific elements which can then be used
within that `switch` case:
```groovy
switch (x) {
  [a]      -> "list of $a"
  [head,*] -> "first element is $head"
}
```

The `*` wildcard is used to match any number elements but up until now, could not be bound to a binding variable.
Now it is possible to bind this to a variable which will then be a list of those elements.

For example, a simple quick sort:
```groovy
def qsort(x) {
  switch (x) {
    [], [_] -> x
    [h,*t]  -> qsort(x.filter{ it < h }) + h + qsort(x.filter{ it >= x})
  }
}
```

### Other Enhancements
