/**
 * Class that captures current execution state and can be "continued" at some point in the future.
 * When suspending we throw a Continuation object and each caller in the call stack will catch
 * any Continuation thrown and then create its own Continuation chained to the one caught where
 * it can store its state. Then the caller throws its new Continuation for its caller to then catch.
 * <p>
 * The state at each caller includes the local variable values, a MethodHandle that points to the
 * method of the caller and an integer that represents a logical location in the method that the
 * compiler generates for each location where a Continuation could be thrown.
 * <p>
 * When continuing we continue from where the first Continuation thrown left off. When that code
 * finishes, since it no longer has its caller to return to, it returns here, and we find the next
 * Continuation in the chain and continue it.
 * <p>
 * If we need to suspend when in the middle of continuing from a previous suspension then we throw
 * a new Continuation and chain it to the rest of the Continuation objects in the current chain so
 * that when it is resumed and returns here we will find the rest of the chain to continue with.
