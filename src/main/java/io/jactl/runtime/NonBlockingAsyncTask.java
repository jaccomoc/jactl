/**
 * A non-blocking async task where the work is initiated from the event loop thread
 * after the script has been suspended. The original event loop thread returns from
 * the script execution and when the result of the asynchronous task has completed
 * the result is passed to the script, and it continues from where it left off on an
 * event loop thread.
 * <p>
 * The difference between a NonBlockingAsyncTask and a BlockingAsyncTask is that the
 * BlockingAsyncTask executes completely on a blocking thread while the NonBlockingAsyncTask
 * is executed on the event loop since it will just initiate the work in a non-blocking way
 * (e.g. set a timer or send a message or initiate an async database operation) and then return
 * immediately. When the background task completes (message received, timer expires, etc.) the
 * result is then used to resume the script on an event loop thread.
